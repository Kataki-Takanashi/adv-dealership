### Project Overview

This is a dealership management application with the following features:

1. **Vehicle Inventory Management**:
   - Search for vehicles with multiple filters (e.g., make, model, year, price, mileage).
   - Add, remove, sell, or lease vehicles from the inventory
2. **Admin Interface**:
   - Secure, password-protected admin interface accessible only by authorized administrators.
   - Support for multiple admin accounts, each with individual login credentials.
3. **Security Features**:
   - Passwords are stored as SHA-256 hashes for security; plaintext passwords are never stored.
   - Password hashing is applied at account creation and every time a login attempt is made.
   - To prevent unauthorized access, only 3 login attempts are allowed before further attempts are locked.

### Dealership CSV

Explanation of the file and its format:

1. **General Structure**:
   - The file contains a header row with dealership information, followed by rows representing individual vehicle entries.
   - All data is contained within a single column, with values separated by the pipe symbol (|).
   
2. **Header**:
    - The header row contains basic dealership information in the format: `Dealership Name | Address | Contact Number`
    - Example: `D&E Motors|123 Awesome Lane|555-867-5309`
   
3. **Vehicle Data Rows**:
   - Each row after the header represents one vehicle, with fields separated by the | symbol. The fields appear to follow this structure: `VIN | Year | Make | Model | Type | Color | Mileage | Price`
   - `VIN` -  A unique identifier for the vehicle.
   - `Year` -  Model year of the vehicle.
   - `Make` -  Manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Toyota, Honda).
   - `Model` -  Specific model of the vehicle (e.g., Corolla, Civic).
   - `Type` -  Classification of the vehicle (e.g., car, truck).
   - `Color` -  Exterior color of the vehicle.
   - `Mileage` -  Odometer reading in miles.
   - `Price` -  Sale or lease price of the vehicle in dollars.

4. **Sample Data**:
   - Hereâ€™s a sample entry based on the format observed: `837492|2022|Toyota|Corolla|car|White|1500|25999.99`
   - This entry represents a `2022 Toyota Corolla`, classified as a `white` `car` with `1,500` miles on it, priced at `$25,999.99`.

5. **Assumptions the program makes**:
   - **All** values are assumed to be `strings`, except for `Mileage` and `Price`, which are **numeric**.

### Lease and Finance Rates

These constants are used to calculate specific costs for lease and financing options within contracts:

- `Lease Fee Rate` - Set at `7% of the vehicle price` for lease contracts.
- `Expected End Value Rate` - Calculated as `50% of the vehicle price` to determine the expected vehicle value at the end of the lease term.
- `Finance Rate` - Annual interest rate of `4%` for financed sales contracts.
- `Lease Term` - Standard `3-year (36 months)` lease period.

These constants help standardize financial terms, ensuring consistent calculation of fees, residual values, and monthly payments across all contracts.
